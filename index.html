    <h3>Luis Lionel Andres “Leo” Messi was born on June 24, 1987, in Rosario, Argentina. As a young boy, Messi tagged
        along when his two older brothers played soccer with their friends, unintimidated by the bigger boys. At the age
        of 8, he was recruited to join the youth system of Newell's Old Boys, a Rosario-based club.

        Recognizably smaller than most of the kids in his age group, Messi was eventually diagnosed by doctors as
        suffering from a hormone deficiency that restricted his growth. Messi’s parents, Jorge and Ceclia, decided on a
        regimen of nightly growth-hormone injections for their son, though it soon proved impossible to pay several
        hundred dollars per month for the medication.

        So, at the age of 13, when Messi was offered the chance to train at soccer powerhouse FC Barcelona’s youth
        academy, La Masia, and have his medical bills covered by the team, Messi’s family picked up and moved across the
        Atlantic to make a new home in Spain. Although he was often homesick in his new country, Messi moved quickly
        through the junior system ranks.

        Ultimately, Messi’s short stature—5 feet, 7 inches—combined with his speed and relentless attacking style, has
        drawn comparisons to another famous Argentinian footballer, Diego Maradona.</h3><br>

        At age 13, Messi signed with FC Barcelona. His first appearance for the team was when he was 16. On May 1, 2005,
        Messi put himself in the record books as the youngest player to ever score a goal for the franchise.

        Messi steered Barcelona to a wealth of success, most notably in 2009, when the left-footer’s team captured the
        Champions League, La Liga, and Spanish Super Cup titles. That same year, after two consecutive runner-up
        finishes, he took home his first FIFA World Player of the Year honor, as well as his first Ballon d’Or award,
        the top European individual honor in football.

        Messi became the first Argentinian player to win the Ballon d’Or. Even the great Maradona gushed about his
        fellow countryman. “I see him as very similar to me,” the retired player told the BBC. “He’s a leader and is
        offering lessons in beautiful football. He has something different than any other player in the world.”

        Amazingly, the soccer wizard continued to improve, discovering new ways to elude defenders while leading
        Barcelona to La Liga and Spanish Super Cup championships in 2010 and 2011, as well as the ’11 Champions League
        title.

        Messi embarked on an all-out assault on the record books in 2012. He became the first player to score five goals
        in a Champions League match in early March, and a few weeks later, he surpassed Cesar Rodriguez’s club-record
        232 goals to become Barcelona’s all-time leading scorer. By the end of the year, Messi had accumulated an
        astounding 91 goals in club and international play, eclipsing the 85 netted in a single calendar year by Gerd
        Muller in 1972. Fittingly, he broke another record when he was named the Ballon d’Or winner for the fourth
        consecutive time.

        In 2013, the soccer great came back to earth somewhat due to the persistence of hamstring injuries, but he
        regained his record-breaking form by becoming the all-time leading scorer in La Liga and Champions League play
        in late 2014.

        After helping Barcelona achieve a historic second treble in 2015, he was honored with his fifth Ballon d’Or
        trophy. Four years later, following another La Liga title, Messi again established a new standard for excellence
        by claiming his sixth Ballon d’Or.

        On August 5, 2021, FC Barcelona announced it couldn’t resign Messi due to the team’s budget constraints and La
        Liga restrictions. Despite having voiced his desire to leave the club the prior season, Messi bid a teary
        farewell after 17 seasons: “This is really difficult for me after so many years spent here, being here my entire
        life. I’m not ready for this.”
        Messi played for FC Barcelona for 17 seasons before joining Paris Saint-Germain in 2021 for two seasons. In June
        2023, he announced plans to join MLS’ Inter Miami club.<BR><BR>MESSI INDENTITY:<BR><BR>
